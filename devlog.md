Starting Project 1
Goal: Build prefix calculator in Racket
Plan: set up files, test interactive and batch mode


##10-24-25 5:55pm
Plan: add mode.rkt and calculator.rkt, run tests

##10-25-25 12:32 am
- Uploaded my first trial of code
- Error occured because mode.rkt was missing the #lang racket declaration at the top

##10-25-25 1:10 am
- Early working draft of calculator.rkt; still has error and needs fix in multiple areas
